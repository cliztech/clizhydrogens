- Use a shared brand guideline and asset library so all agents reference same materials  
- Automate handoffs wherever possible (e.g., when Product agent finalises SKU, Creative agent auto-receives request via workflow; Marketing agent schedules campaign flows)  
- Monitor KPIs across agents and feed data from Data & Analytics agent to all other agents
